# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the contest) 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [x] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [x] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [x] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [x] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 24 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [x] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the contest ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the contest. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this README

Under "SPONSORS ADD INFO HERE" heading below, include the following:

- [x] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-foundation#readme))
  - [x] When linking, please provide all links as full absolute links versus relative links
  - [x] All information should be provided in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [x] Under the "Scope" heading, provide the name of each contract and:
  - [x] source lines of code (excluding blank lines and comments) in each
  - [ ] external contracts called in each
  - [ ] libraries used in each
- [x] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [x] Does the token conform to the ERC-20 standard? In what specific ways does it differ?
- [x] Describe anything else that adds any special logic that makes your approach unique
- [x] Identify any areas of specific concern in reviewing the code
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] See also: [this checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746)

# Overview

`juice-buyback` provides a [data source](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/data-source/) and [delegate](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/delegate/) which maximise the [project token](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/tokens/) received by the contributor when they call `pay` on the [terminal](https://docs.juicebox.money/dev/learn/glossary/payment-terminal/). In order to do so, the delegate will either mint new tokens from the project ("vanilla" path, bypassing the delegate) or use the funds from `pay` to buy existing tokens in a Uniswap V3 pool ("buyback" path), depending on the best quote available at the time of the call.

This first iteration is optimised for ETH as terminal token.

# Tests

Anyone can deploy `juice-buyback` using the provided forge script.

To run this repo, you'll need [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/) installed.

Install the dependencies with `npm install && git submodule update --init --force --recursive`, you should then be able to run the tests using `forge test` or deploy a new delegate using `forge script Deploy` (and the correct arguments, based on the chain and key you want to use - see the [Foundry docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)).
